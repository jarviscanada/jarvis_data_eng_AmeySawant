**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AmeySawant/tree/masterhttps://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AmeySawant/linux_sql)]: Implemented a comprehensive Linux cluster monitoring solution utilizing Bash scripts to gather detailed hardware specifications and resource usage data from each server. This data is systematically collected and stored in a PostgreSQL database, which is provisioned using Docker for easy deployment and management. The monitoring scripts are scheduled to run periodically using crontab, ensuring continuous data collection. SQL queries are then employed to analyze the stored data, providing valuable insights into the cluster's performance and resource utilization.


## Highlighted Projects

I meticulously crafted detailed functional and technical requirements, defining data interfaces for seamless data integration, reconciliation algorithms to ensure accurate matching of trades, and robust exception-handling workflows to manage discrepancies. Additionally, I specified comprehensive reporting capabilities to provide clear insights into the reconciliation process, enhancing the overall efficiency and reliability of trade operations.
